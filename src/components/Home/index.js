      Being a MERN stack developer trainee in Nxtwave's CCBP 4.0 Intensive
      program has been an inspiring journey for me. Every day, I am learning and
      growing in my full-stack development skills, with a focus on the latest
      4.0 technologies. I am driven by the challenge of tackling coding
      obstacles head-on and translating my ideas into hands-on projects.
